clog is a simplistic logging library written in C.

## Example usage

    #include <clog.h>

    int main(int argc, char *argv[])
    {
      clog *logger = clog_open();
      clog_add_stream(logger, stderr);
      clog_add_path(logger, "example.log");

      clog_fatal(logger, "This is a fatal error message.");
      clog_error(logger, "This is a regular error message.");
      clog_warn(logger, "This is a warning message.");
      clog_info(logger, "This is an informative message.");
      clog_debug(logger, "This is a debug message.");

      clog_close(logger);

      return 0;
    }

The log level threshold can be configured at compile-time by setting the
`CLOG_THRESHOLD` preprocessor directive to one of `CLOG_LEVEL_DEBUG`,
`CLOG_LEVEL_INFO`, `CLOG_LEVEL_WARN`, `CLOG_LEVEL_ERROR`,
`CLOG_LEVEL_FATAL` or `CLOG_LEVEL_OFF` (turning off logging
completely) like so:

    gcc -DCLOG_THRESHOLD=CLOG_LEVEL_ERROR example.c -o example

This will cause only calls to `clog_error` and `clog_fatal` to produce
output, which is also the default if `CLOG_THRESHOLD` is omitted.
